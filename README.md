# shelldoc: Execute Unix shell commands in documentation as tests

A test:

    $ echo Hello
    Hello

```{caption="Code block example" .shell}
   This is a code block.
   This is line 2.
```

~~~{caption="Code block example" .Shell}
   This is a code block.
   This is line 2.
~~~

This is a single test that executes the first line and compares the output with the second one.
