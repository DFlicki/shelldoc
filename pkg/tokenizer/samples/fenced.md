# Test: a fenced code block with attributes

This should be handled as a code block...

```shell {.line-numbers shelldocexitcode=1 shelldocwhatever}
> echo "Hello World!"
Hello World!
```

```
> echo "Hello World with no language specified!"
Hello World with no language specified!
```

...and the attributes passed to the interaction.
